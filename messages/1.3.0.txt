Highlight Duplicates v1.3.0

	• Added Remove Duplicates Command

		Using this command will remove all duplicate lines from the file. The first instance of each duplicate will be kept.
		This command is similar to the build in "Permute Lines > Unique" function found in the Edit menu, however this will follow this plugin's settings for what is considered a duplicate.

		For example...

		1: <someTag></someTag>
		2: Content
		3: <someTag></someTag>
		4:

		Would result in

		1: <someTag></someTag>
		2: Content
		3:
