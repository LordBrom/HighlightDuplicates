Highlight Duplicates v1.3.0

	â€¢ Added Remove Duplicates Command

		Using this command will remove all duplicate lines from the file. The first instance of each duplicate will be kept.
		This command is similar to the build in "Permute Lines > Unique" function found in the Edit menu, however with follow the Highlight Duplicates settings.

		For example...

		1: <someTag></someTag>
		2: Content
		3: <someTag></someTag>
		4:

		Would result in

		1: <someTag></someTag>
		2: Content
		3:
