Highlight Duplicates v1.3.0

	â€¢ Added Remove Duplicates Command

		Using this command will remove all duplicate lines, after the first instance, from the file. 
		This command is similar to the build in "Permute Lines > Unique" function found in the Edit menu, however this will follow the plugin's settings for what is considered a duplicate.

		For example...

		1: <someTag></someTag>
		2: Content
		3: <someTag></someTag>
		4:

		Would result in

		1: <someTag></someTag>
		2: Content
		3:
